**Summary of Each Work**:

- **Source 1**: [A Model on Charter Rate Prediction in Container Shipping]

  - **[Link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374917813_A_Model_on_Charter_Rate_Prediction_in_Container_Shipping)** 
  - **Objective**: To build a financial forecasting model that predicts container charter rates and supports decision-making in a volatile post-pandemic shipping market.
  - **Methods**: Analysed 7,409 real chartering transactions (2018–2023) from Clarksons using seven regression models, comparing their performance with RMSE and R² metrics.
  - **Outcomes**: XGBoost performed best (RMSE: 0.1833, R²: 0.9015), with key predictors including charter time, TEU, and laycan year/month.
  - **Relation to the Project**: It provides methodological and empirical guidance for building a robust ML model in my own charter rate prediction project, especially regarding model selection, feature engineering, and evaluation.

- **Source 2**: [Forecasting container freight rates using the Prophet forecasting method]

  - **[Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967070X23000185)**
  - **Objective**:To improve the reliability of container freight rate forecasts by incorporating major disruptive events using a mixed-method approach.
  - **Methods**: Extracted 471 events from Lloyds List (2010–2020), categorized them into six types using ML and NLP, and integrated them into a Prophet time series model across six container routes.
  - **Outcomes**: Determined six important factors in container shipping such as congestion, peak demand, policy, price up, overcapacity, and coronavirus.
